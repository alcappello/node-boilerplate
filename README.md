# node-boilerplate

A very basic boilerplate to run Node.js inside a Docker machine alongside a mongoDB container, a web interface for the DB and a test container to run mocha.


## Prerequisites

- Docker
- npm

## Install

Clone the repository, then run `npm install` and after that `dockere-compose up -d`. Now you should have a simple Hello World at localhost:3000 and the DB interface at localhost:4000.

Good luck with your new Node.js project!
